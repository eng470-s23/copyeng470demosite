# README for demo-site

This repository is a demo for ENG 470/570 students to clone in order to create individual project workspaces. It contains templates for all required components of the final portfolio, written in markdown. (Recommended markdown editor: [dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io/)). 

- **[readme.md](readme.md) (this file)**: a template to record project-level metadata, taken from [UO Libraries' research guide to Doing Digital Projects in the Open](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/doingdigitalprojectsintheopen/workshop2). To customize it, delete this header section up to the horizontal line (---).
- **[license.md](license.md)**: the license defining how others can reuse your data and other content in your repository.
- **[project-log.md](project-log.md)**: a weekly log for tracking your research notes and progress. This is also where your pitch, draft annotated bibliography, and draft environmental scan go. Revised versions of those materials will likely appear in your white paper.
- **[data-management.md](data-management-plan.md)**: your data management plan, explaining how your project files are stored, named, published, and protected. 
- **[presentation.md](presentation.md)**: visual aids for your presentation at our class symposium in week 9. You may choose instead to use PowerPoint, in which case this file will be presentation.ppt or presentation.pptx.
- **[white-paper.md](white-paper.md)**: final write-up of your project and lessons learned from conceptualizing and prototyping a researched digital humanities project. Your white paper will also contain, embed, or link to the project prototype itself.
- **[_config.yml](_config.yml)**: the file that provides basic styling info to turn your repo into a static website. 
- **[index.md](index.md)**: the front page of your website, which can link to or aggregate any other parts of your repo using relative links.

## Credits and Acknowledgments

The creation of this project could have been executed without the multiple informative sources that guided my research. Covering a wide range of topics and academic discussions, my sources included websites, scholarly articles, special archives, and books written about digital culture, literacy, and its impact on activism. Prompted by my ENG 470 class, this project could not have been completed without the help of my teachers and helpful faculty at the University of Oregon. 

More specifically, I would like to acknowledge my professor, Mattie Burkert, who helped me guide and narrow down my overall research topic and question. Her insight provided me with direction and guidance to unpack the complexity of this topic and how it would be most effectively absorbed and acted upon by my target audience.

This project acknowledges the inconsistencies that students face in educational settings. Targeting scholars and educators, I want to help inform those of the benefits and opportunities that digital media has provided this generation. I also want to provide tools for people who are less familiar with the progression and impact of digital technologies, such as college professors and other supporting faculty. 

I would also like to acknowledge that the use of the S.W.I.N.E. group is not intentionally used in a negative example of activism at the Univeristy of Oregon. The mentioning and research done by this student activist group are simply to recognize the power of using your voice and speaking on what you believe in.
