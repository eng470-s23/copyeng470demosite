## How Digital Media Affects Student Activism at the University of Oregon: A Toolkit to Embracing Student Voices and Improving Equity
### Research Question: How has digital media like social media platforms and other digital media outlets impacted the way students and scholars absorb and act upon activism regarding social issues on college campuses?
### Abstract
  In this project, I want to explore the effects of digital media on student activism at the University of Oregon. I will be analyzing a collection of historical archives and records of a student activist group, *S.W.I.N.E.*, that took place during the 1960s and 70s, comparing their recognition to more recent activist groups on campus. This will also be directed as insight toward scholars, highlighting the significance of creating an inclusive community on campus. The main comparison that will be analyzed and discussed in this project is the role of technology and how it has assisted or deconstructed the progression of generating awareness and creating visible changes within college communities. I will also be analyzing the role of technology outside of student activism, addressing the ways in which false media prohibits our ability to trust our peers. The role of digital literacy allows us to understand how skepticism toward recent media outrage regarding the UO campus union, is discussed further in a case study. Receiving national recognition allows audiences to gauge a better understanding of current activism on campus and the magnitude of leverage it holds because of media. 
 
These individual areas of research will allow audiences to better understand why media can act as both a tool and an obstacle when trying to maintain a grasp on the ever-evolving society in which we live. I want to bring awareness to the benefits of technology on a college campus when used progressively and efficiently by students who have the potential to change the tone of political and social discussions beyond campus walls.

### Introduction
Technology has had a drastic effect on the way we consume and generate digital media and such advancements are responsible for the information we receive through our devices every day. The capability of creating an online community, spreading information efficiently, and bringing together like-minded individuals from any differentiating background is a small portion of the connection that technology has provided recent generations of students. The University of Oregon has had a long history of student activism due to its establishment on Kalapuyan land, where Native American tribes initially settled. This naturally brought a lot of attention to the mistreatment of Native Americans through the schools’ education, naming one of the freshman residency halls after the Kalapuya people. Several indigenous peoples course studies are also offered at the University as a way to generate awareness amongst the student body. These honorable mentions were some of the initial ways in which the University of Oregon’s student body became passionate about using their voices to generate change in the conversation about multiculturalism within student life. 
  
Growing up with technology, this generation of college students has become well aware of the benefits which technology provides. Using social media platforms to keep up with their friends and family, younger generations tend to underestimate the power of unified voices on public platforms. This potential power has generated subconscious awareness for our educators as to how the information they present will be perceived and acted upon. There is great room for error in terms of teaching style, vocabulary, and pre-existing beliefs that impact the way students absorb information. With the addition of advanced technology, now students have been given the power to change the tone of the conversation, present information originally, and directly act upon the given topic. The majority of my historical research will take place between the 1960s and 70s, a period of time in the University of Oregon’s history when students' voices were begging to be acknowledged.
  
### S.W.I.N.E.
 *S.W.I.N.E*, which stands for Students Wildly Indignant about Nearly Everything, was a student-led organization created in 1965 at the University of Oregon whose founding ideals stemmed from mockery and satirization of political protest groups. Inspired by cartoonist Al Capp L’il Abner, the anti-activist group created illustrated comic-like newsletters and stood for nearly 4 years under the University of Oregon’s administration. Their work included publishing satirical articles with corresponding cartoons that spoofed current political cultures and climates. Receiving a wide range of reactions from the surrounding community for “protesting everything until everything is demolished and destroyed”, the organization gained a great deal of attention for the sole purpose of being so radically different (Jim Hill, Daily Emerald, 1966). The idea behind this student pursuit was to impose the domination of the “radical middle”, a political stance that held no logical means to end any specific injustice. With internalized goals to be “the first in a network of chapters on campuses throughout the nation”, *S.W.I.N.E*. wanted to make a large-scale change (Oregon Daily Emerald 1966). 
  
 While the organization only lasted until 1969, students were able to gather and record findings which can be located in the school's special collections and university archives. Findings within the historical archive include newspaper articles, student contracts, copies of artworks, and other insightful glimpses into what student activism once looked like at the University of Oregon. Using this student-led group as a primary example of an organization that would benefit from advanced digital media, I want to explore more recent student activist groups and how they are effectively using the media to generate awareness for their cause. I am also curious to explore how a student-led organization group like *S.W.I.N.E* would be received in the media today.

## History of Student Activism at the University of Oregon
Student activism has had a long history at the University of Oregon dating back to the early 20th century. Throughout the years, the student body has been responsible for the organization of protests regarding a large range of causes including civil rights, anti-war efforts, racial injustice, environmentalism, and LGBTQ+ rights.

The initial wave of student activism on UO’s campus came during the 1960s and early 1970s when students began protesting against the Vietnam War. In 1968, a group of students formed the Black Student Union (BSU) to demand greater and equal representation and resources for black students on campus. Because technology and digital media more specifically were not to the level of advancement they are today, they adhered to more physical revolts against the institution. Students organized protests and sit-ins to apply pressure on the university’s administration. This eventually secured the funding for a Black cultural center on campus.

During this time, the anti-war movement was also gaining recognition on UO’s campus. Students who felt passionately about this topic organized marches, rallies, and protests to express their rage and dissatisfaction. In 1970, four UO students were shot and killed by National Guard troops during a protest that was taking place at Kent State University, sparking outrage amongst college campuses and within local communities.

Moving forward to the 1980s and 90s, student activism at the University of Oregon began shifting its focus to environmental issues and LGBTQ+ rights. The Environmental Issues Task Force was formed by students in 1988 to advocate for sustainability and environmental responsibility on campus. They were able to successfully establish an Environmental Studies program and a recycling program on campus.

Also during this time, LGBTQ+ students and their allies organized to demand greater visibility and support for queer students on campus. In 1933, the Queer Student Union (QSU) was created to provide a safe and inclusive space for LGBTQ+ students to advocate their rights. They lobbied for the creation of a studies program regarding LGBTQ+ rights as well as the inclusion of gender identity and sexual orientation in the university’s non-discrimination policy.

More recently, student activism at the Univeristy of Oregon has tended to more issues regarding racial injustice, sexual assault prevention, and immigration rights. In 2015, students organized a series of protests under the banner of the Black Lives Movement, calling for greater attention to systematic racism and police brutality. In 2016, student activists also organized a “Take Back the Night” march to raise awareness about sexual assault and support survivors on and outside of campus.

## What is Digital Media? How Are We Using it?
Digital media refers to any electronic media that are created, viewed, distributed, and stored using digital technologies. Formats include text, images, audio, and video content that can be shared and accessed through computers, smartphones, tablets, and any other digital devices that remain connected to the internet.

Digital media has transcended the way society perceives the world. Adding layers of complexity and confusion that manipulate our ability to form a concurrent opinion with the rest of the world. While digital media today serves far greater purposes than simply providing an alternative access source to information, it also allows users to gain control over conversations that remain dominated by biased corporations. Granting younger generations the ability to use their social platforms to advocate their beliefs and rights is the future of activism and is ultimately responsible for the progression of our nation's lack of equity.

Other than providing the younger generations with a platform to amplify their voices, digital media, and technology has provided student activists with the ability to reach larger audiences that surpass geographical boundaries. While activism is a major component of the University of Oregon’s culture and pride, the majority of college campuses across the U.S. draw attention to and promote activism toward similar social justice topics. Joining forces across college campuses and taking those voices to social media makes matters much more difficult for higher powers to ignore, exemplifying the importance of digital media and social platforms.

## Digital Literacy - Generational Skepticism in the Media
Digital literacy can be defined as the ability to find, evaluate, understand, and communicate information using digital technologies. Digital literacy also includes being able to recognize and critically assess the reliability of online information. While society is well aware of the algorithms and biases that exist in social media, it often goes unnoticed when attaining information through online scholarly databases and search engines. This analysis helps society understand the power of presentation through digital media. 

Digital Citizenship with Social Media: Participatory Practices of Teaching and Learning in Secondary Education discusses the impact of social media upon the malleable minds of younger generations, recognizing the importance of attaining digital citizenship and literacy. Gleason and Von Gillern recognize the responsibility of digital citizenship by addressing the obstacle of attaining digital literacy. Educators and those of higher educational influence remain skeptical of modern digital media because the technology that is being used to present such information is modernized and vastly dissimilar to methods used in the past. One of the biggest obstacles this generation faces is differentiating scholarly or informed media from algorithmically biased media. How we interact with media is recorded and analyzed by computers in order to present individual users with information that already aligns with their pre-existing beliefs. This creates problems for the impressionable minds of college-aged students who are trying to maintain a grasp of the fast-paced and politically polarizing environment. 

There is a significant gap with regard to the level of skepticism that exists in social media versus media that has been categorized as scholarly. Social media is viewed through a critical lens by older generations as they believe that contradicting and biased information floods the screens of younger audiences, tainting their ability to form comprehensive and valid opinions and beliefs. A Perspective on Student Activism by Scott D. Thomas offers an informed point of view with regard to “the level of hostility directed toward existing institutions.” (Thomas, 2) S.W.I.N.E. acts as a perfect example of such hostile beliefs as their main goal was to protest “everything and anything” in order to gain traction in the media. There is an angst that has consumed younger generations because of the perceived lack of credibility within their works and findings. This anger comes from a place of helplessness, as the future of our generation is being controlled and compared to our nation's broken past. Such inconsistencies directly correlate with students’ ability to partake in activism both on and off campus, making it significantly harder to gain recognition for their efforts to improve the community. 

### How has media today transformed our consumption of activism?
The University of Oregon provides students with access to historic archives and files that have allowed them to build upon past organizations and student-led activist groups. Patterson explains how “historians and archivists play an active role in shaping history and collective memory by choosing what to document, communicate, or make accessible to the public.” As the lack of digital literacy has begun to negatively correlate with technology’s advancements, it has become increasingly more difficult to ensure that students are able to access and analyze historic works to their fullest extent. Patterson emphasizes how it “is essential to closely examine which stories are being told, how they are being told, and by whom they are being told, because there are profound negative consequences of absence and misrepresentation in mainstream media and archives.” Such misinterpretations could be responsible for the future of injustice, meaning the possibility of history repeating itself skyrockets.

With the use of more modern digital media such as Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and Twitter student-led groups are now able to mass share events, updates, and general information regarding their cause. Utilizing social media platforms act as a tool to quickly access support and education about the university’s inclusion groups for students that may be unaware of how to access such information through the schools’ website. Instagram is a great platform to create an online community where students can directly communicate with one another as well as stay informed about upcoming events and social organizations, creating accessible opportunities to meet like-minded individuals in their community.

## Case Study: University of Oregon Students Fight for Union, alleged retaliation

![oregonlive_2023_studentunion.jpeg](https://github.com/eng470-s23/jamieyanofskydemosight/blob/main/images/oregonlive_2023_studentunion.jpeg)

In order to understand the educational outcome of student activist efforts and what specific actions the University of Oregon is taking to educate its students regarding the correlation between activism, digital literacy, and higher education levels, I wanted to examine a case study. The case study I am examining focuses on recent student unionization efforts to fight for pay raises, shorter pay periods, anti-harassment policies, and more. 

Student activist and sophomore Will Garrahan spoke outside of UO’s campus housing offices during a rally on Friday, February 17th with efforts to become re-hired by the school. Garrahan is one of the 3,000 students who is employed through on-campus jobs and faces oppression from the workforce (Oregon Live). Earlier in the week, Garrahan filed a complaint against the University of Oregon with the state Employment Relations Board “alleging he’d been unfairly fired from his job in a campus dining hall because of his work as a union organizer” (Oregon Live). Union organizers have also been told by the administration that they are prohibited from speaking to academic classes or promoting card signing at campus events because its been labeled as political activity” (Oregon Live). With efforts to provide a positive employee experience for all workers, students gathered in support of Garrahan with signs, megaphones, and cameras to document and share the news to larger, more accessible platforms via social media. 

Gaining recognition on a national scale, student organizers think “they’ll be the largest undergraduate student union in a growing national trend” (Oregon Live). Relying on the community and other groups who face similar occupational oppression through campus employment, organizers created a GoFundMe in order to help hire a lawyer to advance Garrahan’s labor complaint. The most significant goal of the campaign is to shorten the pay periods for students working on campus, as most students are waiting more than “40 days to receive their first paycheck - something students allege violates state law requiring employees to get paid within 35 days” (Oregon Live). 

National news channels recognized the expansiveness of this protest and claim for equity, predicting that they believe that UO will consist of the “largest undergraduate student union at a public university” (The Nation). Wheeler encapsulates the urgency of this matter, explaining how unionization efforts with regard to labor laws have been in discussion amongst other universities across the U.S. for quite some time now. With 3,000 workers at the University of Oregon, there has been an extensive effort made by the student employees to create an equitable work environment before standards become unlivable. The use of digital media has allowed organizers to create online “fundraising to cover campaign costs for potential wage and legal support if a student is fired for organizing” (The Nation). This provides a sense of safety, community, and support for oppressed students who are afraid or not in a place where they can afford to use their voices to stand up for themselves and their rights. Social media has been a proficient tool in maximizing visibility, as students aim to “raise awareness of the benefits of unions and instances of union busting” by sharing their personal experiences on their own platforms (The Nation). 

Elizabeth White, a senior in the housing services center, claims that constantly worrying about money and equal pay prohibits students from being more present in classes and “doing the thing we are here to do” (The Nation). This reasoning is exactly why student activism should be broadcasted on larger and more visible scales, as acting upon injustice directly correlates with student ability to obtain and retain information in the classrooms. Posting on social media, sharing personal stories, or even re-posting others who have been victims of systemic oppression is activism. School boards and those of higher power existing outside of oppressed unions remain either unaffected or even receive benefits from unequal treatment, which is why taking matters into the hands of those directly affected will result in the most transformative outcome.

Digital media has created a significant and notable impact in efforts to maximize student and faculty support to improve equity. “The union campaign has offered support to its workers by dispersing pamphlets that inform students of their workplace rights and has set up an online portal to document instances of unfair labor practices.” (The Nation) The use of an online documentation tool creates an opportunity for groups to track progress and receive direct engagement from those who are both directly and indirectly affected. This also contributes to improving digital literacy between student practices and large-scale injustices that occur outside of the community.

## Implication of The L.A.C.E. Framework

[University of Oregon's L.A.C.E. Framework](https://inclusion.uoregon.edu/lace-framework)

In order to raise personal awareness and knowledge within the University of Oregon’s student body and faculty, a framework entitled L.A.C.E. has been developed and incorporated into the university’s community guidelines. Standing for love, authenticity, courage, and empathy, this framework focuses on deepening individual self-awareness and knowledge. The framework is divided into three sections where the first recognizes self-awareness, the second focuses on building connections with individuals and communities, and the third strives to transform individuals, systems, and societies.

![Where I'm From Poem](https://github.com/eng470-s23/jamieyanofskydemosight/blob/main/images/uo_2017_whereimfrom_lace1.jpeg)

The framework is inspired by the poem Where I’m From by George Ella Lyon which uses sensory language as a way to tell her origin story. The project prompted students to use descriptive language to discuss core memories of their upbringing, highlighting the beauty of their individuality. The L.A.C.E. Framework is constructed for students to increase their sense of self-awareness in order to generate awareness in their surrounding environments. Self-awareness means becoming aware of where an individual, whether that be yourself or others, comes from or recognizing hardships they might have had to overcome because of their upbringing. Obtaining a sense of community through knowledge should be at the core of all educational systems, as it allows students to feel comfortable in an environment where it's normal to make mistakes and normal to hold different opinions than one's peers. Gaining inspiration from such heartwarming and self-expressive pieces of written works, the L.A.C.E. framework is essentially created by students, for students. Similar frameworks have been incorporated into a large majority of Universities within the United States with one common goal: becoming aware and informed about one’s community and the importance of preserving and incorporating diversity and inclusion within education systems.
