## reading plan
- My intended reading plan is to block off 1-2 hours every other day to focus on course readings and research. My least busy days are Tuesdays and Thursdays which would allow me to prioitize readings prior to class meeting times. Allocating enough time between Monday and Friday for research readings should be easy, as I have gaps between classes and know of abundance of quiet places to work on campus.

## annotated bibliography

### source 1 annotation
- citation: S.W.I.N.E (Students Wildly Indignant about Nearly Everything) records, UA 107, Special Collections & University Archives, University of Oregon Libraries, Eugene, Oregon, 1966-1967.
- summary: Students Wildly Indignant about Nearly Everything (S.W.I.N.E.) was a student group at the University of Oregon. The collection contains office files, budget files, news clippings, newsletters, and membership lists that provide insight as to how the student group operated, what work they produced, and how they were perceived by the surrounding community.
- potential use for project: This source acted as my primary example of a student activist group that gained a great amount of attention for being different and mocking the current behaviors of protesters during the political climate of the 1960s. I analyzed a multitude of different files and newspaper clippings that informed me about how information was spread and what methods of advocacy were deemed as successful on UO’s campus. This acted as a great comparison for current student activist groups on campus and allowed me to understand the progression of successful methods of activism. I also asked the question, “If media and technology were at the level of advancement they are now, would S.W.I.N.E. still be an active group on campus today”? I aim to answer this question by understanding  how and why modern methods of activism through digital media are so successful.

Student Activism as an Agent of Social Change: A Phenomenal Analysis of Contemporary Campus Unrest](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED407902.pdf).
- summary: Provided me with insight as to how student activism first began and why it became so effective amongst college campuses. Rhoads explains the “power” behind student voices and their ability to alter the course of our nation's future to adhere to a more socially progressive environment. Researchers explore motivations behind student activism by examining the various issues that have sparked unrest across college campuses. They explore strategies employed by student activists such as protests, sit-ins, and social media campaigns in order to analyze their effectiveness in achieving long-lasting and tangible outcomes.
- potential use for project: Helped me form an analysis of what methods of student activism on college campuses have been successful in recent years and create a comparison between the University of Oregon specifically. This source also allowed me to understand the institutional changes that occur on college campuses when social unrest occurs and assess the long-term effects of such changes on campus environments and broader societies in general.

[Disrupt, Defy, and Demand: Movements toward Multiculturalism at the University of Oregon, 1968-2015](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1256910).
- summary: This source acted as a historical and comprehensive analysis of the student movements that advocated for multiculturalism at the University of Oregon over the span of 5 decades. Examining the demands, strategies, and overall impact of these movements, Patterson highlights the contributions and outcomes of creating a more inclusive and diverse campus that encourages students to use their voices. Drawing attention to the 1960s when the Civil Rights Movement was gaining momentum, Patterson analyzes how these broader social changes influenced activism on UO’s campus socially and within the school's education system.
- potential use for project: This source adds value to my project by understanding the history of student activism, multiculturalism, and social change on university campuses. This source also offers insight into more current and future efforts to promote equity and inclusion in higher education, and how these efforts could act as a tool in professional industries and future career paths. As Patterson also draws attention to the response of the administration to such demands, I will use this as a marker to see what methods of activism would still deem as successful and if there is an opportunity for new ones in digital media.

### contribution
*Describe what you will do and why. What is unique about your project and what you will be contributing to your scholarly community? What problem will be resolved, what question will be answered, or what opportunity will be created through your project?*

- In this project I will unpack the role of digital media in student activism and how it has created both opportunities and challenges for this technologically advanced generation of students. Something unique about this project is the inclusion of past activist groups on campus and how they operated in terms of successful and harmful acts of social and political justice. I also discuss the implementation of today’s advanced media and technologies that have caused a generational gap in democratic practices, highlighting the ways in which the University of Oregon specifically has overcome such hardships and what methods have changed over time.

### methods
*What tools and methods will you use, and why are those the best technologies for your purposes?*

- The tools and methods used for the construction of this multimedia essay are simple yet provide accurate and diverse opinions on the rise of student activism and digital media. Tools used for this essay include social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok to assess the current standing of activist groups across campus. Another tool I implicated during my research was creating a student survey that allowed me to collect data and opinions from students, activists, or both. The information I intend to gather will allow me to form a general idea regarding where students stand in terms of activism and if they feel like they are making a visible difference in their community.

### stakeholders / audiences
*For whom is your project intended: academics, members of the public, your institution, etc.? Who is invested in the final products? How can you reach that audience and meet the needs of interested parties and stakeholders?*

- My project is initially intended for the academic education team and student population at the Univeristy of Oregon but could be accessed and absorbed by anyone interested in the relationship between digital media and activism. I intend to reach my target audience by making this multi-media essay accessible on student repositories and possibly even the Digital Humanities Website at UO. My goal is to educate and inform audiences of the inconsistencies and benefits that exist within digital media, encouraging younger generations to use their voice and media platforms to spread awareness with intention and credibility. 

### dependencies and resources
*What resources do you need to reach your goals? Consider equipment, technologies, programs, web hosting, data storage, expertise, and time. Where will you get the resources you need? Identify specific entities, offices, subscriptions, spaces, etc. available through UO or the community.*

- Some resources I have utilized to reach my goal include the Special Archives Collection located at the Knight Library at the University of Oregon to anaylze my primary source: The S.W.I.N.E collection. Technologies I will be using include a qualitics survey and understanding the use and creating my own GitHub. I did not need to utilize any extra data storage or equipment to gather my information. A few resources I will need include pre-exisiting multircultural student repositories and visiting multicultural center located at the EMU to ask questions and get a better understanding of the current state of student activism on campus. I also need to acquire licenses for certain images from the S.W.I.N.E. Special Archives Collection as well as licensing for screen grabs from social media platforms currently utilized by UO. I have reached out to the SUCA for permission to use the files found in the archives for my final project.
