# about this file

- The original documentation of this file, A Multimedia Essay (.pdf), is where the original organization and documentation of my research was kept and later divided into separate files titled accordingly:
  - Abstract
  - Introduction
  - S.W.I.N.E.
  - Historical Archives 
  - History of Student Activism at UO
  - What is Digital Media?
  - Digital Literacy: A Take on Generational Skepticism in the Media
  - How has media today transformed our consumption of activism?
  - Case Study
  - Current UO Student Activist Groups
  - L.A.C.E.
  - Concluding Thoughts
- My sources have acted as a framework that guided the creation of my essay in which I added personal insight and comparisons to novel digital media practices and its interaction with student actvism. The files inlcude [.pdf, .jpeg, .jpg, .png,       ]

# expected data and formats

- File formats used to collect and document my data include qualitative data (.txt, .pdf) and digital media data (.jpeg, .jpg, and .png). This consists of an abundance of scholarly and historical written works in the formats of articles, essays, and books as well as website links. The data will be recorded in Google Docs which will then later be processed to Markdown format on GitHub. The file names will include the source, key term of photo, and will be in a .jpeg format.

# documentation and metadata

- The majority of my data has been gathered through original observations regarding the standpoint of digital media and how it interacts with student activism and on a broader scale, education systems entirely. My data also consists of the use of historical and scholarly articles written about the significance and impact of encouraging student voices. These sources have acted as a framework that guided the creation of my Multimedia Essay in which I initially tracked my findings and data. I will be documenting my files and images on the README section of the images folder. The final publication format will be in the layout of a ‘ToolKit’ that provides users with access to original insight. Using Google Docs as my original software, I will be uploading individual areas of information and research in the format of a Tool Kit on GitHub.

# organization and storage

- My file naming convention will be kept simple and straightforward and organized by area of research and specific works. For example, my explanation and insight towards the L.A.C.E. Framework will be kept in one file along with other files that link readers to the UO website. Consisting of .jpegs and .txts formats, all research conducted for that area of study will include laceframework.jpeg or .pdf.. Version control practices will be organized by specific areas of research within the Tool Kit using GitHub. 
- For example, this source: Oregon Daily Emerald Newspaper, 1966, S.W.I.N.E (Students Wildly Indignant about Nearly Everything) records, UA 107, Special Collections & University Archives, University of Oregon Libraries, Eugene, Oregon.
The file name would be: ua_dailyemerald_essenceofinactivsm.jpeg

# sharing, publication, and archiving

- In order to provide access to others access to the data I would like to deposit my data to UO’s Data Repository. DOI links with associated data will be stored and archived in the UO Scholars’ Bank and will be preserved according to the current standards and practices. There should be no restrictions as to who can access my data. Anticipated changes regarding the current standpoint of the topic may be subject to change as time goes on but the information will not be updated if changes occur before the publication date. 

# accessibility

- The data will be made accessible for users with disabilities by using large fonts, contrasting and evident color schemes, and organized by different headings. I want the data to be easy to follow and draw upon for future use or insight regarding the subject matter. I will be naming file links for clarity and providing users will the ability to draw upon specific areas of the research with straightforward link headings and placements.
